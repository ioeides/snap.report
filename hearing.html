      <p> The House committee on good government acts on the request of several lawmakers, including House assistant majority leaders Pammy Zamora and Zia Alonto Adiong

      <p> MANILA, Philippines – The House committee on good government and public accountability has agreed to postpone its Friday, November 29, hearing on the alleged fund misuse of Vice President Sara Duterte to allow her to appear before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on the same day.

      <p> Manila 3rd District Representative Joel Chua, panel chairman, said in a news briefing on Thursday, November 28, that committee acted on the request of House assistant majority leaders Pammy Zamora and Zia Alonto Adiong and other House members.
        
      <p> Chua also said that this way, the House committee “could not be used as an excuse” for Duterte not to appear before NBI chief Jaime Magtaas on Friday morning.
        
      <p> Based on the NBI subpoena served to Duterte on Tuesday, November 26, she is “to shed light on the investigation for alleged grave threats and possible violation” of the Anti-Terrorism Act in connection to her statements against President Ferdinand Marcos, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, and Speaker Martin Romualdez during an online news conference on Saturday, November 23.
